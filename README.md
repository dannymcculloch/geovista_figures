# geovista_figures

You can download the html file [here](https://github.com/dannymcculloch/geovista_figures/blob/main/scene-export.html). It's a bit too big to view on GitHub, but you can download it and view it locally without having to worry about installing any software. 

If you like it and/or you have any ideas on how to improve it - let me know!
